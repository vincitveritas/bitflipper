
input first, function second, parser reads backwards first
always removes white space after "#" & "*" and before "#" & "*"

#		(marks function blocks)
()		(comments)
*		(marks data block)

data blocks are always fused into following function block (input -> function)

that's all you need, hopefully
and everything is code unless datafied
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
()
* hello world # print		(everything after * is data, everything after # is function)
()
* 2 # int8 # x		(2 is data, casts as int, puts it into x
			(not declared "code" are variables)
()
* condition 
	* Truth # print 	
	* not Truth # print
#if			(previous 1 block is "else", previous 2 is "true")
()
(if just one condition, aka if only one function block before the data block)
* condition
	* Happy printing # print
#if
()
* 132 * x # decVar		(set x to 123)
()

(reads switch block first, then goes looking through previous blocks until "alone" data block)

* DataToSwitchOn
	* House # do this if data is house
	* Tiger # do this if data is Tiger
# switch
()

*x
