- you just have function blocks marked in with # and comments inside ()
- always removes whitespace after # and before #
- functions / variables are single write, then read only unless resetted 
- file always ends with invisible #
- *something* locks something to read only in this file
- shipped with functions are always locked unless " # unlockdefaults # " is present

# stdin # x			(stdin reads terminal input and writes it into the next block)
# + # 2 # x		(+ adds followed block into 2nd followed block)

# set # int # 2 # y		(sets following block into 2nd following block, when read, fuses int and 2 as casted int so set # 2 # y)

# if # condition # execute this when true
# elif # condition # execute if true # execute if not
